### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a PHP artisan, full stack dev and server wrangler. I'm also a freelance developer/consultant working for various clients (like [Sentry](https://sentry.io) maintaining the PHP/Laravel SDKs) & working on making [Chief Tools](https://chief.app/?ref=gh-stayallive) a collection of first class tools I wish I had when I started out building applications on the web.

- Want to read the longer story? Check out my [about me](https://github.com/stayallive/stayallive/blob/main/ABOUT-ME.md) page
- Want to check out my tools? See [Chief Tools](https://chief.app/?ref=gh-stayallive) and read more about that journey on the [about page](https://chief.app/about?ref=gh-stayallive)
- I sometimes write about Laravel and servers or other things I find cool, you can read that on the [Chief Tools blog](https://chief.app/blog?ref=gh-stayallive)
- Whenever I find something cool I like to bookmark it for "later" (IYKYK), they are public to [browse](https://raindrop.io/stayallive/bookmarks-19262112)

If you want to get in touch shoot me an [email](mailto:alex+gh@bouma.dev) or hit me up on Twitter [@stayallive](https://twitter.com/stayallive) (yeah, thatâ€™s with 2 lâ€™s) or on Mastodon: [@alex@bouma.social](https://bouma.social/@alex) (and yes I host that myself). If you want to thank me for my work you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/stayallive).

Want to share server access or sharing something that needs to be secret, use one of my [public keys](https://github.com/stayallive/stayallive/blob/main/PUBLIC-KEYS.md).
