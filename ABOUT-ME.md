**tl;dr about me:** Iâ€™m a PHP artisan, full stack dev and server wrangler. I am a freelance developer/consultant & working on making [Chief Tools](https://chief.app/?ref=gh-stayallive) a collection of first class tools I wish I had when I started out.

### About the artisan part

I *love* the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework and have built quite some applications (both private and [public](https://chief.app?ref=gh-stayallive)) with it (since version 3 all the way up to the bleeding edge). Have any questions? Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stayallive), [Mastodon](https://bouma.social/alex) or shoot me an [email](mailto:alex+laravel@bouma.dev).

### About the full stack dev and server wrangler part

#### Chief Tools

I'm currently building [Chief Tools](https://chief.app/?ref=gh-stayallive) which is a collection of my many side-projects, although it got a bit out of hand and I think I can call them regular projects at this point. If you are curious you can check out what it is al about on the [about page](https://chief.app/about?ref=gh-stayallive).

#### Simulise

I co-founded [Simulise](https://www.simulise.com) and worked on it for a little over 10 years before moving on to new adventures. Simulise is an SaaS we built for schools where students can show *who* they are instead of only getting a list of grades, a little excerpt from the site tells it best:

> Students have to present themselves better than ever. After the student's formal education has finished, employers and clients expect to see insight into the skills of a person and want to know what to expect from a candidate. Educational institutions are expected to give skills a permanent place in the curriculum. This is why the online portfolio of Simulise makes those skills transparent for students and teachers -both during school time and afterwards.Â *â€”*Â [*Simulise*](https://www.simulise.com/en)

My responsibility was running the "IT" side of the company, some would call this the CTO role but for our size this was never my official title. This ranged from (leading) the development of our SaaS application (which I built from the ground up) to keeping our servers going and keep them going fast.

### Hosting

On the side I run a small hosting company, founded by me, called [Alboweb](https://www.alboweb.nl). I host a large variety of sites, from very small sites to some as big as >14M page views a day (although these don't run on the standard shared servers of course).

With Alboweb I provide shared and managed hosting services or consult on bigger setups. It is a great way to keep my sysadmin skills up-to-date and pet my ego when I look at our beautiful uptime reports ðŸ¤“.

#### Consultancy

In the few free hours I have I do consulting and work on a freelance basis as [Devalex](https://devalex.nl). I work with very little to very big companies on tasks ranging from setting up infrastructure, reviewing their code or to simply to step in to get sh\*t done.

#### Sentry

I'm also one of the core developers for the [Sentry](https://sentry.io) [PHP SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) and the [Laravel integration](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) (and unofficially also the [WordPress integration](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry)). If you don't know Sentry and build any kind of application, go check them out to level up your error reporting (I am *not* paid to say that).

#### iCulture

I also work and worked as resident code monkey [@iCulture](https://www.iculture.nl?ref=gh-stayallive), the largest (and best of course) Dutch Apple focused news site. Here I worked to make WordPress less awkward and [better/faster/stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ) for the writers and readers. The site is built on WordPress, but also uses the [Laravel Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com) framework (to make our iOS apps blazing fast ðŸ”¥) and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (as our awesome [search](http://www.iculture.nl/?s=nieuwe%20zoekfunctie) backbone).

### Get in contact
